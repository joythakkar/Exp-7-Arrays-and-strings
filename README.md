# Exp-7-Arrays-and-strings
AIM

     To study and implement various operations on arrays in C such as printing elements, searching for a number, and finding the sum, average, maximum, and minimum of the array elements.

SOFTWARE USED

    Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

OBJECTIVES

    Understand how to declare and initialize arrays

    Learn to print elements of an array

    Implement search operation in an array

    Compute the sum of array elements

    Calculate the average value of the array

    Find the maximum and minimum elements

    Enhance logical and problem-solving skills through array manipulation

THEORY

     In C programming, an array is a data structure used to store a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same data type. Arrays allow programmers to store multiple values under a single variable name, with access via index numbers starting from 0. Arrays are especially useful when working with collections of data such as scores, readings, or numeric datasets.

Common operations performed on arrays include:

    Traversing and printing each element using loops

    Searching for a specific element using linear or binary search

    Calculating the sum and average of elements by iterating through the array

    Finding the maximum and minimum values by comparing elements one by one

     - Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, making access to elements efficient. These operations form the foundation for more advanced programming concepts such as matrices, sorting algorithms, and data processing.

    - Mastering arrays helps in improving a programmerâ€™s ability to handle large sets of data and build optimized and scalable programs.


SAMPLE OUTPUTS:

     1. Print elements of an array:

       Array elements: 10 20 30 40 50
    2. Search for a number in an array:

         Enter number to search: 30
         Number found at position 3
    3. Calculate sum of array elements:

          Sum of elements: 150
    4. Calculate average of array elements:

        Average of elements: 30.00
    5. Find maximum element:

        Maximum element: 50
    6. Find minimum element:

        Minimum element: 10

CONCLUSION

     In this experiment, we studied the fundamental concepts of arrays in C and implemented various operations such as printing elements, searching for a value, and calculating the sum, average, maximum, and minimum of array elements. Arrays provide a simple and efficient way to store and manipulate collections of data of the same type. Through practical implementation, we gained a deeper understanding of how to use loops and conditional statements to process array data effectively. These skills are essential for solving real-world programming problems and form the basis for more advanced data structures and algorithms. Overall, working with arrays enhances logical thinking, code efficiency, and problem-solving abilities in C programming.
